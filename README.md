# Teutsch Partners Coding Take-home

## Project Instructions

Create a calculator web app using React.js (and no other third-party libraries). The calculator should be capable of performing the following operations at a minimum (feel free to add more if you have time):

* addition
* subtraction
* multiplication
* division
* exponentiation

The end user should be able to operate the calculator via both keyboard and mouse. You should (and will likely need to) give more attention to keyboard interaction. Accessibility is a key concern.

You don't worry about messing around with BigInt to provide higher precision than regular JavaScript floats have by default.

If you have any doubts or questions about our expectations for the project, please do not hesitate to reach out! Being proactive about clarifying development expectations is a necessity for the position! 

## Development Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Information on the commands you will need to know is provided below, but you can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed! The easiest way to deploy will likely either be to use [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages), but you can use any hosting option. To learn more about deployment, see the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).
